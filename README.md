# NETFLIX

This application (a **Netflix clone**) was built using React (**Custom Hooks**, **Context**), **Firebase** & **Styled Components**. I have built the following pages within this application: **sign in**, **sign up**, **browse** & lastly the **homepage**. There are four different pages, some using **protected routes** with **auth listeners**. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

I used **compound components** (just a design pattern) to build my components, and there's over 10 examples as to how these are used. The styling is all handled via styled components.
